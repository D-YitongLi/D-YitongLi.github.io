Iâ€™m Yitong Li, a Master's student in the **College of Computing** at **Georgia Tech**, where I am advised by Professor [Bo Dai](https://bo-dai.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, also from **Georgia Tech**.

My research interests primarily lie in **machine learning**, with a particular focus on **generative model**, **multi-modality**, and **reinforcement learning**. I am actively seeking a PhD position for the Fall 2025 cycle.


## Publications

- (NeurIPS 2024) **Diffusion Spectral Representation for Reinforcement Learning**
  <br/>
  _Dmitry Shribak\*, Chen-Xiao Gao\*, **Yitong Li**, Chenjun Xiao, Bo Dai_
  <br/>
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16121)]
  [[Code](https://github.com/haotiansun14/rl-rep/tree/main/agent/diffsrdrq)]\\
  We propose an algorithm that leverages the flexibility of diffusion models for representation learning to enable efficient policy optimization, mitigating the time-consuming sampling process typically involved in diffusion models.


- (ACL 2024 Findings) **ProgGen: Generating Named Entity Recognition Datasets Step-by-step with Self-Reflexive Large Language Models**
  <br/>
  _Yuzhao Heng, Chunyuan Deng, **Yitong Li**, Yue Yu, Yinghao Li, Rongzhi Zhang, Chao Zhang_
  <br/>
  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10464)]
  [[Code](https://github.com/StefanHeng/ProgGen)]\\
  We propose a LLMs-based framework to generate diverse and accurate task-specific datasets from very few-shot samples via requirement sampling and self-reflection.
